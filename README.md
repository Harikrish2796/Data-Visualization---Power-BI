AdventureWorks BI Dashboard

Overview

Welcome to the AdventureWorks BI Dashboard project! This repository showcases a comprehensive Business Intelligence (BI) solution designed for AdventureWorks, a global manufacturing company specializing in cycling equipment and accessories. This project highlights my ability to transform raw data into actionable insights using Power BI.

Project Scenario

The Situation
As a newly hired Business Intelligence Analyst at AdventureWorks, my primary responsibility is to provide critical insights and data-driven solutions to assist the management team in making informed decisions.

Brief
To address the management's needs, the objective was to:
- Track Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Including sales, revenue, profit, and returns.
- Compare Regional Performance: Analyzing the sales data across different regions.
- Analyze Product-Level Trends: Identifying trends and patterns within product categories.
- Identify High-Value Customers: Focusing on customer segmentation and value analysis.

Challenge
I was provided with a folder of raw CSV files encompassing detailed data on transactions, returns, products, customers, and sales territories. The task was to transform this data into a coherent and insightful dashboard using Power BI.

Objectives and Solution

Using Power BI Desktop, I accomplished the following:

- Data Transformation:
  - Connected to and transformed raw CSV data into a format suitable for analysis.
  - Cleaned and processed data to ensure accuracy and consistency.

- Data Modeling:
  - Built a relational data model linking various datasets (transactions, returns, products, customers, and sales territories).
  - Established relationships between tables to support complex queries and analysis.

- DAX Calculations:
  - Created calculated columns and measures using Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to derive KPIs and other critical metrics.
  - Developed dynamic measures for flexible and interactive reporting.

- Dashboard Design:
  - Designed an interactive and visually appealing dashboard to present the analysis effectively.
  - Incorporated visual elements such as charts, graphs, and slicers to facilitate deep dives into the data.
